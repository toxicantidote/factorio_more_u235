Sick of waiting forever for Uranium-235 production? This mod allows you to configure the chance of uranium-235 production at the expense of uranium-238 production.

Affects uranium refinement and enrichment in the base game.

Don't download anything below version 0.0.3 - I made stupid mistakes and it won't work properly.
